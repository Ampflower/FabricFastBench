# License

This mod, QuickBench & Tweaks, is licensed under the [MIT] license, inherited from the upstreams,
[FastWorkbench for Forge][FastWorkbench-git] and [FastBench for Fabric][FabricFastBench-git],
made by [Shadows of Fire] and [Tfarcenim] respectively.

Due to the lack of clarity from the upstream repository,
FabricFastBench is assumed to have been licensed under the [MIT] license,
as its upstream, FastWorkbench is licensed as [MIT],
and the [CurseForge project][FabricFastBench-curse] claims it is also licensed as [MIT],
unlike the [GitHub repository][FabricFastBench-git], which claims it's licensed as [CC0-1.0].

It is maybe fair to assume
that the code solely produced by [Tfarcenim] maybe used under the [CC0-1.0] when without context.
However, given the original README.md stated that the template was under the [CC0-1.0], and everything else says [MIT],
it should be assumed the license of choice was intended to be [MIT].

Several contributions from [Ampflower] are also available under [CC0-1.0],
and will be clearly marked in the license header of each file.
You may freely use snippets or full copies of code solely contributed by Ampflower under the terms of the [CC0-1.0].
If the snippets have been combined, remixed or derived from the surrounding code,
you must assume the terms of the [MIT] license may be applied.

Both the [CC0-1.0] and [MIT] licenses are provided for reference.

## Disclaimer:

The dates and names used within the copyright header have been reconstructed based on the licenses and git history of
both [FastWorkbench][FastWorkbench-git] and [FastBench for Fabric][FabricFastBench-git].
